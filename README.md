## ‚ö° Introduction: <br>

<p>
A facial recognition system is a technology capable of matching a human face from a digital image or a video frame against a database of faces, typically employed to authenticate users through ID verification services, works by pinpointing and measuring facial features from a given image.

<p>
  So I coded this in python with the help of VS Code. In the guidance of <a href="https://github.com/amanindiamuzz"><b>@amanindiamuzz</b></a>. I just added some extra features     like   now it is recognisng the eyes and smile also. 
  
  ## ‚ö° Conclusion: <br>
  
  It's now recognising only human faces .<br>

‚Ä¢ `pip install --upgrade pip` <br> 
‚Ä¢ `pip install opencv-python` <br>
‚Ä¢ `pip install pandas` <br> 
‚Ä¢ `pip install numpy` <br>
‚Ä¢ `conda install--` <br>
‚Ä¢ `pip install dlib` <br><br>
‚Ä¢ Now Fork my repository and then clone the repository as your local repository.<br>
‚Ä¢ ‚ö† NOTE: All the .xml data files and the python file should be in the same directory<br><br>
‚Ä¢ To start the application you can call `python Face_detection.py` in you cmd/terminal.<br><br>
