<h1 align="center"> 👱🏻‍♀️ Face Recognition 👱🏻‍♂️ </h1><br>

## ⚡ Introduction: <br>

<p>
A facial recognition system is a technology capable of matching a human face from a digital image or a video frame against a database of faces, typically employed to authenticate users through ID verification services, works by pinpointing and measuring facial features from a given image.

  So I coded this in python with the help of VS Code. In the guidance of <a href="https://github.com/amanindiamuzz"><b>@amanindiamuzz</b></a> <br> I just added some extra features like now it is recognisng the eyes and smile also.<br>
  So now the <b>Conclusion</b> is it's now recognising only human faces .<br>
